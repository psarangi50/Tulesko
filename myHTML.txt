MadMax Movie Transcript

Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 Australian action film co-written, produced, and directed by George Miller. Miller collaborated with Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris on the screenplay. The fourth installment and a reboot[7] of the Mad Max franchise, it is a joint Australian-American[8] venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic desert wasteland where petrol and water are scarce commodities. It follows Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy), who joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) to flee from cult leader Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army in an armoured tanker truck, leading to a lengthy road battle. The film also features Nicholas Hoult, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Riley Keough, ZoÃ« Kravitz, Abbey Lee, and Courtney Eaton.


Fury Road was in development hell for many years, with pre-production starting as early as 1997. Attempts to shoot the film in 2001 and 2003 were delayed due to the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. In 2007, after focusing on Happy Feet,
 Miller decided to pursue it again. He briefly considered producing it 
as a computer-animated film but abandoned it in favour of live-action. 
In 2009, Miller announced that filming would begin in early 2011. Hardy 
was cast as Max in June 2010, with production planned to begin that 
November. Principal photography was delayed several more times before 
beginning in July 2012. The film wrapped in December 2012, although additional footage was shot in November 2013.
